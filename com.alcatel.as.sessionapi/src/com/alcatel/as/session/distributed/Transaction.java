   <h3>Understanding Transactions</h3>

   <p/>Because sessions are shared objects potentially accessed concurrently by several JVMs, care must be taken with respect to synchronization, 
   and failure handling. This is where transactions will help you. 

   The session API makes you create, update and destroy sessions inside so-called ACID transaction. The term ACID historically refers to the basic properties 
  of a database transaction: <EM><B>Atomicity</EM></B>, <EM><B>Consistency</EM></B>, 
  <EM><B>Isolation</EM></B>, and <EM><B>Durability</EM></B>. 

  <p/><b>Atomicity</b> means that the entire sequence of actions in the transaction must be either completed or aborted. The transaction 
  cannot be partially successful. Combined with Isolation, Atomicity specifies that any transaction will view all actions taken by 
  any other transaction as having occurred all together, or atomically. In particular, should a JVM crashes while executing a transaction, 
  none of its partial effect will take place.

  <p/><b>Consistency</b> specifies that the transaction either creates a new and valid state of data in which all changes have been applied, or, 
  in case of failure, returns all data to the state existing before the transaction started.

  <p/><b>Isolation</b> specifies that actions taken within a transaction are not visible to any other transactions until the transaction 
  is committed.

  <p/><b>Durability</b> specifies that all changes made and committed successfully by transactions are permanent and must survive system failure. 
  For example, in the event of a failure and system restart, the data is available in the state existing after the last committed 
  transaction.

  <h3>Transaction API usage</h3>

 <P>If you are familiar with java transaction API (like JTA), the session API will look familiar to you. You'll find 
 the <CODE>commit()</CODE> and <CODE>rollback()</CODE> usual methods. There is a big difference though. Using a traditional transaction API you write something like:  
     <PRE><CODE>

    begin transaction
    ...
    update table-a
    ...
    if (condition-x)
        commit transaction
    else if (condition-y)
        update table-b
        commit transaction
    else
        rollback transaction
 <p>
.     </PRE></CODE>
 <P>That is, a transaction is a mere context of execution associated to the current thread, which implicitly glues several updates  
into one big atomic operation. In this example, <EM>table-a</EM> and <EM>table-b</EM> will be atomically updated. 
 Should <EM>table-a</EM> and <EM>table-b</EM> be managed by different underlying database systems, a two-phase commit message exchange 
would be required to make sure both updates are indeed performed.
 <P>Using the session API, you write something different. It looks like this:
     <PRE><CODE>

    begin transaction for session 'bob'
    ...
    update 'bob' attribute 'a'
    ...
    if (condition-x)
        commit 
    else if (condition-y)
        update 'bob' attribute 'b'
        commit 
    else
        rollback 
      </PRE></CODE>
 <P>As you can see, the difference is that a transaction is <B><EM>always associated to one and only one session object</B></EM>. 
A transaction never glues updates on more than one session object. It only glues update on several attributes on a given session.  
Because transaction never imply several sessions, no two-phase commit algorithm is required, ever.

<P>Why is this important ? Remember the session API targets IO-driven proxy applications, not traditional database applications 
such as banking applications. The session engine must provide a scalable and highly-available main memory distributed (session) database, 
exhibiting a very low access and update time. Distributed transactions with two phase commit do not fit such requirements. 

<P>Why transaction then ? Because it makes it a lot easier for you to write a robust application. Without transaction, you would need to
consider every potential failure, leaving your shared sessions in a partial inconsistent state. You should also deal with locking to 
prevent concurrent accesses. All this is possible, but difficult and error prone.  

<P>What is needed are light-weight transactions providing fast completion and state replication. This is exactly what the SessionAPI implements.  
Let's now have a look at a real piece of code. First, here is how you create a new session. In this example, it
is created with two attributes.
<CODE><PRE>
    // First you need to implement the Transaction interface. 
    public class MyTransaction extends Transaction {

        public MyTransaction(SessionType type, String sessionId, int flags) {
            super(sessionType, sessionId, flags);
        }

        // this is the transaction body. It is executed once the session has been created.
        public void execute(Session session) throws SessionException {
            // check if we are the creator or if the session existed already.
            if (session.created())
       	        session.setAttribute("a1", "initial value");
                session.setAttribute("a2", "initial value");
            }
    	    session.commit("done");
        }
    }

    ...
    // here is how to use this transaction using the SessionManager.execute method.
    // This method is synchronous. It blocks until the transaction has terminated.
    // The returned value is the value passed to the commit method.

    String result = (String) mgr.execute(new MyTransaction(type, "bob", Transaction.TX_CREATE_GET));
.     </PRE></CODE>
<P>As shown by this example, you always submit a Transaction for execution. The following example show the same transaction
executed asynchronously.
<CODE><PRE>
    // This is the listener upcalled once the transaction terminated.

    public class MyTransactionListener extends TransactionListener {

        // the transaction completed. The result parameters holds the value passed
        // to the commit method.
        public void transactionCompleted(Transaction tx, Serializable result) {
            ...
        }

        // the transaction failed. Typically your execute method has thrown an exception. 
        public void transactionFailed(Transaction tx, SessionException exc);
            ...
        }
    }
    ...
    // This method is asynchronous. It returns immediately. When the transaction will terminate, 
    // you'll be upcalled in your listener transactionCompleted method.
    mgr.execute(new MyTransaction(type, "bob", Transaction.TX_CREATE_GET), new MyTransactionListener());
    ...
</PRE></CODE>

   <h3>Advanced use</h3>

  <P>ACID properties are strong properties that come at some cost. Should several transactions access the same session 
  at the same time, only one at a time will run, while others are temporarily blocked. In practice, you can choose to execute transactions 
  under weaker guarantees (see {@linkplain com.alcatel.as.session.distributed.Transaction#TX_SERIALIZED TX_SERIALIZED} 
  versus {@linkplain com.alcatel.as.session.distributed.Transaction#TX_READ_COMMITTED TX_READ_COMMITTED} isolation levels).
