# This property contains the list of all authorized clients along with the matching shared secrets.
#
# The format is :
# client_ip secret ["nocheck"]
#
# The client_ip can be a mask or a specific host (then it is prefixed with "H:").
# The last (optional) field "nocheck" disables secret checking (but the secret value is still used for responses).
#
# Examples:
#   H:192.32.31.45     customSecret
#   H:192.32.31.46     otherSecret       nocheck
#   255.255.255.255    secretForWorld
#
# The list is ordered: the first matching client_ip is used.
