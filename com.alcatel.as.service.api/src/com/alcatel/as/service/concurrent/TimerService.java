/**
 * Timer Service used to schedule timer tasks in platform executors.
 * This interface extends ScheduledExecutorService and provides additional 
 * methods in order to allow to schedule a task within an explicit Executor. 
 * By default, ScheculedExecutorService will execute expired tasks using the executor
 * of the current thread which scheduled the task.
 * 
 * <p> Two kinds of TimerService may be used: an exact timer service (precision=millis), 
 * and inaccurate timer service (precision=50/100 millis, for support of high performance
 * timers). To use exact timers, you can use the OSGi service property filter "(strict=true)",
 * when defining an OSGi dependency over the timer service. Likewise, you can use the
 * OSGi filter "(strict=false") if you need to use the inaccurate (but faster) timer service.
 * 
 * <p>Important note: When the ScheduledExecutorService methods are invoked, 
 * the timers will be executed using the current thread executor (at the time the timer
 * was scheduled). However, it may be possible that the PlatformExecutors service is not 
 * currently available when scheduling timers; in this case the expired tasks will be 
 * invoked from the internal TimerService scheduler thread.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * <p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class Test implements Runnable {
 *   private PlatformExecutor sipExecutor;
 *   private TimerService timerService;
 *   
 *   &#64;Reference(target="(id=sip)")
 *   void bindSipExecutor(PlatformExecutor sip) {
 *       this.sipExecutor = sip;
 *   }
 *   
 *   &#64;Reference(target="(strict=false)")
 *   void bindTimerService(TimerService timerService) {
 *       this.timerService = timerService;
 *   }
 *   
 *   &#64;Activate
 *   void start() {
 *       timerService.schedule(this.sipExecutor, this, 1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
 *   }
 * 
 *   public void run() {
 *      // timeout executed within the sip executor.
 *   }
 * } 
 * </pre>
 *
