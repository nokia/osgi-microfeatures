/**
 * PlatformExecutor main entry point. This interface defines the contract of scheduling some tasks in 
 * a given platform executor. Tasks may have two level of priorities: DEFAULT, and HIGH.<p>
 * 
 * <ul><li> DEFAULT priority: tasks are executed after all HIGH priority tasks.
 * <li> HIGH priority tasks are executed before any pending DEFAULT tasks.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * By default, tasks are scheduled using the DEFAULT priority level.
 * You can choose the task priority using the @link {@link ExecutorPolicy} interface.
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * <p>
 * <hr>
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre> {@code
 * class Test {
 *   private PlatformExecutor threadPool;
 *   private PlatformExecutors executors;
 *   
 *   void bindPlatformExecutors(PlatformExecutors executors) {
 *     this.threadPool = executors.getIOThreadPoolExecutor();
 *     this.executors = executors;
 *   }
 *   
 *   void doBlockingIO() {
 *     // Use a thread pool in order to perform a blocking IO ...
 *     
 *     final Executor callback = executors.getCurrentThreadContext().getCallbackExecutor();
 * 
 *     threadPool.execute(new Runnable() {
 *       public void run() {
 *          // Do a blocking io and callback the caller thread ...
 *          
 *          // And callback the caller thread
 *          callback.execute(new Runnable() {
 * 	           public void run() {
 * 	             // We'll be run within the thread where doBlockingIO was invoked.
 * 	             proceed();
 * 	           }
 * 	        });
 *       }
 *     });
 *   }
 * 
 *   void proceed() {
 *      // The IO operation has completed, proceed in our original thread ...
 *   }
