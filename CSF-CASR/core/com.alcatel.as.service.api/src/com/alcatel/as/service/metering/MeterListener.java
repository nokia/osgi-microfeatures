 * your meter listener in the OSGi service registry, using the {@link MeteringConstants#METER_NAME}
 * service property.
 * 
 * This service property will be used to map your meter listener to the meter whose name is matching your
 * "metering.meterName" service property.
 * <b>Note:</b>: if you want your listener to be registered in the meter before the meter is incremented
 * by any application, then you can also specify the {@link MeteringConstants#METER_LISTENERS} in your bundle.
 * This header indicates the number of listeners to wait for before activating the metering service.
