#Put your bundle URLs in this file, one per line.
#The bundles will be fetched and installed in the order they are listed.
#In addition to http/https and file URLs, Pax URLs custom protocols 
#are supported.
#See this page for more information: 
#https://ops4j1.jira.com/wiki/spaces/paxurl/pages/12058761/User+Guide

#Some examples:

#Simple HTTP URLs:
#http://internal.domain/my-bundle.jar

#File URLs
#file:///tmp/my-bundle.jar

#mvn URLs let you fetch a bundle from a Maven repository.  
#See Pax mvn URL doc for info on how the the Maven settings 
#are determined.
#mvn:bundle-groupId/bundle-artifactId/1.0.0

#wrap URLs are combined with other URLs to automatically
#transform plain JARs into OSGi bundles. Defaults are usually good 
#enough, but the transformation can be fully customized if needed.
#See the doc on the Pax URL website for more info
