#
# Indicates for each diameter application the session stickiness policy
#
# Format
# policy [-name <policy-name>] -app <diameter-application> [-cmd <command-code>]* [-noState] [-transactionState] [-sessionState]
# where
# <policy-name> :
#	- an optional name
# <diameter-application> :
#	- the diameter application in numeric format (may start with 0x for hexa formatting)
#	- 0 stands for all applications
# <command-code> : 
#	- the command code in numeric format (may start with 0x for hexa formatting)
#	- 0 stands for all commands (by default when not specified)
#	- it is possible to mention many command codes in the same line
# -noState
#       - the message has no transaction or session stickiness : it can be routed in a random way
# -transactionState
#       - the message has a transaction state : its retransmissions must go to the same destination : the message end to end identifier is used
# -sessionState
#       - the message carries a session id : Session-ID AVP by default
# -avp
#       - indicates the avp to use in the case of sessionState (in lieu of Session-Id). The format is vendor-id/avp-code (hence by default it is 0/263)
#
# 
# examples:
# policy -name myPolicy -app 123 -cmd 1 -cmd 2 -transactionState
# policy -name useUserName -app 0xA1 -sessionState -avp 0/1
# policy -name default -app 0 -noState
#
# if the config is empty, -noState applies to all messages.
